    I Joined the community of web revolution by creating my own Portfolio on the Internet.

    This is built using:
    <ul>
        <li>Python Flask</li>
        <li>A lot of Jinja2 and HTML</li>
        <li>Hosted on Heroku, because <code>git push heroku master</code></li>
    </ul>

    <span> Thanks to Rishabh Bhardhwaj for making this project open-source. I copied The HTML CSS and JS from their repo and coded backend by myself. </span>
